	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) techniques are widely used for identifying the corticospinal tract (CST) white matter pathways as part of presurgical planning. However, mass effects in patients with brain tumors tend to cause anatomical distortions and compensatory functional reorganization of the cortex, which may lead to inaccurate mapping of white matter tracts. To overcome these problems, we compared different region-of-interest (ROI) selection schemes to track CST fibers in patients with brain tumors. Our study investigated the CSTs of 16 patients with intracranial tumors. The patients were classified into 3 subgroups according to the spatial relationships of the lesion and the primary motor cortex (PMC)/internal capsule. Specifically, we investigated the key factors that cause distorted tractography in patients with tumors. We compared 3 CST tractography methods that used different ROI selection schemes. The results indicate that CST fiber tracking methods based only on anatomical ROIs could possibly lead to distortions near the PMC region and may be unable to effectively localize the PMC. In contrast, the dual ROI method, which uses ROIs that have been selected from both blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) activation and anatomical landmarks, enabled the tracking of fibers to the motor cortex. The results demonstrate that the dual ROI method can localize the entire CST fiber pathway and can accurately describe the spatial relationships of CST fibers relative to the tumor. These results illustrate the reliability of using fMRI-guided DTT in patients with tumors. The combination of fMRI and anatomical information enhances the identification of tracts of interest in brains with anatomical deformations, which provides neurosurgeons with a more accurate approach for visualizing and localizing white matter fiber tracts in patients with brain tumors. This approach enhances surgical performance and perserves brain function.},

Clearly communicating the manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, yet essential to lay a solid foundation for comprehensive atlases. Segmentation protocols must be designed so the interpretation of the requested tasks as well as locating structural landmarks is anatomically accurate, intuitive and reproducible. In this work, we quantified the reproducibility of a first iteration of an open/public multi-bundle segmentation protocol. This allowed us to establish a baseline for its reproducibility as well as to identify the limitations for future iterations.

	abstract = {Fiber tract segmentation is a prerequisite for the tract-based statistical analysis and plays a crucial role in understanding brain structure and function. The previous researches mainly consist of two steps: deﬁning and computing the similarity features of ﬁbers, and then adopting machine learning algorithm for clustering or classiﬁcation. Among them, how to deﬁne similarity is the basic premise and assumption of the whole method, and determines its potential reliability and application. The similarity features deﬁned by previous studies ranged from geometric to anatomical, and then to functional characteristics, accordingly, the resulting ﬁber tracts seem more and more meaningful, while their reliability declined. Therefore, here we still adopt geometric feature for ﬁber tract segmentation, and put forward a novel descriptor (FiberGeoMap) for representing ﬁber’s geometric feature, which can depict effectively the shape and position of ﬁber, and can be inputted into our revised Transformer encoder network, called as FiberGeoMap Learner, which can well fully leverage the ﬁber’s features. Experimental results showed that the FiberGeoMap combined with FiberGeoMap Learner can effectively express ﬁber’s geometric features, and differentiate the 103 various ﬁber tracts, furthermore, the common ﬁber tracts across individuals can be identiﬁed by this method, thus avoiding additional image registration in preprocessing. The comparative experiments demonstrated that the proposed method had better performance than the existing methods.

	Averaging is commonly used for data reduction/aggregation to analyse high-dimensional MRI data, but this often leads to information loss. To address this issue, we developed a novel technique that integrates diffusion tensor metrics along the whole volume of the fibre bundle using a 3D mesh-morphing technique coupled with principal component analysis for delineating case and control groups. Brain diffusion tensor MRI scans of high school rugby union players (n = 30, age 16–18) were acquired on a 3 T MRI before and after the sports season. A non-contact sport athlete cohort with matching demographics (n = 12) was also scanned. The utility of the new method in detecting differences in diffusion tensor metrics of the right corticospinal tract between contact and non-contact sport athletes was explored. The first step was to run automated tractography on each subject’s native space. A template model of the right corticospinal tract was generated and morphed into each subject’s native shape and space, matching individual geometry and diffusion metric distributions with minimal information loss. The common dimension of the 20 480 diffusion metrics allowed further data aggregation using principal component analysis to cluster the case and control groups as well as visualization of diffusion metric statistics (mean, ±2 SD). Our approach of analysing the whole volume of white matter tracts led to a clear delineation between the rugby and control cohort, which was not possible with the traditional averaging method. Moreover, our approach accounts for the individual subject’s variations in diffusion tensor metrics to visualize group differences in quantitative MR data. This approach may benefit future prediction models based on other quantitative MRI methods.},

	Methods Sixty-six patients with ALS and 43 healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study in the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC). Participants underwent a harmonized neuroimaging protocol across 4 centers that included diﬀusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment of WM integrity. Three visits were accompanied by clinical assessments of disability (ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised [ALSFRS-R]) and upper motor neuron (UMN) function. Voxel-wise whole-brain and quantitative tract-wise DTI assessments were done at baseline and longitudinally. Correction for site variance incorporated data from healthy controls and from healthy volunteers who underwent the DTI protocol at each center.
	Results Patients with ALS had a mean progressive decline in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corticospinal tract (CST) and frontal lobes. Tract-wise analysis revealed reduced FA in the CST, corticopontine/corticorubral tract, and corticostriatal tract. CST FA correlated with UMN function, and frontal lobe FA correlated with the ALSFRS-R score. A progressive decline in CST FA correlated with a decline in the ALSFRS-R score and worsening UMN signs. Patients with fast vs slow progression had a greater reduction in FA of the CST and upper frontal lobe.
	Conclusions Progressive WM degeneration in ALS is most prominent in the CST and frontal lobes and, to a lesser degree, in the corticopontine/corticorubral tracts and corticostriatal pathways. With the use of a harmonized imaging protocol and incorporation of analytic methods to address siterelated variances, this study is an important milestone toward developing DTI biomarkers for cerebral degeneration in ALS.},

	abstract = {Purpose: DTI characterizes tissue microstructure and provides proxy measures of nerve health. Echo-planar imaging is a popular method of acquiring DTI but is susceptible to various artifacts (e.g., susceptibility, motion, and eddy currents), which may be ameliorated via preprocessing. There are many pipelines available but limited data comparing their performance, which provides the rationale for this study.
	Methods: DTI was acquired from the upper limb of heathy volunteers at 3T in blip-up and blip-down directions. Data were independently corrected using (i) FSL’s TOPUP \& eddy, (ii) FSL’s TOPUP, (iii) DSI Studio, and (iv) TORTOISE. DTI metrics were extracted from the median, radial, and ulnar nerves and compared (between pipelines) using mixed-effects linear regression. The geometric similarity of corrected b = 0 images and the slice matched T1-weighted (T1w) images were computed using the Sörenson-Dice coefficient.
	Results: Without preprocessing, the similarity coefficient of the blip-up and blip-down datasets to the T1w was 0⋅80 and 0⋅79, respectively. Preprocessing improved the geometric similarity by 1\% with no difference between pipelines. Compared to TOPUP \& eddy, DSI Studio and TORTOISE generated 2\% and 6\% lower estimates of fractional anisotropy, and 6\% and 13\% higher estimates of radial diffusivity, respectively. Estimates of anisotropy from TOPUP \& eddy versus TOPUP were not different but TOPUP reduced radial diffusivity by 3\%. The agreement of DTI metrics between pipelines was poor.
	Conclusions: Preprocessing DTI from the upper limb improves geometric similarity but the choice of the pipeline introduces clinically important variability in diffusion parameter estimates from peripheral nerves.},

	abstract = {Abstract
	
	The corticospinal tract (CST) is a critically important white matter fiber tract in the human brain that enables control of voluntary movements of the body. The CST exhibits a somatotopic organization, which means that the motor neurons that control specific body parts are arranged in order within the CST. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography is increasingly used to study the anatomy of the CST. However, despite many advances in tractography algorithms over the past decade, modern, state‐of‐the‐art methods still face challenges. In this study, we compare the performance of six widely used tractography methods for reconstructing the CST and its somatotopic organization. These methods include constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) based probabilistic (iFOD1) and deterministic (SD‐Stream) methods, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) tractography methods including multi‐fiber (UKF2T) and single‐fiber (UKF1T) models, the generalized q‐sampling imaging (GQI) based deterministic tractography method, and the TractSeg method. We investigate CST somatotopy by dividing the CST into four subdivisions per hemisphere that originate in the leg, trunk, hand, and face areas of the primary motor cortex. A quantitative and visual comparison is performed using diffusion MRI data (
	N
	= 100 subjects) from the Human Connectome Project. Quantitative evaluations include the reconstruction rate of the eight anatomical subdivisions, the percentage of streamlines in each subdivision, and the coverage of the white matter–gray matter (WM–GM) interface. CST somatotopy is further evaluated by comparing the percentage of streamlines in each subdivision to the cortical volumes for the leg, trunk, hand, and face areas. Overall, UKF2T has the highest reconstruction rate and cortical coverage. It is the only method with a significant positive correlation between the percentage of streamlines in each subdivision and the volume of the corresponding motor cortex. However, our experimental results show that all compared tractography methods are biased toward generating many trunk streamlines (ranging from 35.10\% to 71.66\% of total streamlines across methods). Furthermore, the coverage of the WM–GM interface in the largest motor area (face) is generally low (under 40\%) for all compared tractography methods. Different tractography methods give conflicting results regarding the percentage of streamlines in each subdivision and the volume of the corresponding motor cortex, indicating that there is generally no clear relationship, and that reconstruction of CST somatotopy is still a large challenge. Overall, we conclude that while current tractography methods have made progress toward the well‐known challenge of improving the reconstruction of the lateral projections of the CST, the overall problem of performing a comprehensive CST reconstruction, including clinically important projections in the lateral (hand and face areas) and medial portions (leg area), remains an important challenge for diffusion MRI tractography.},

[Results] Initial cmoputed tomography findings of a 62-year-old man with stuttering speech revealed a hemorrhage in the left thalamus. Fractional anisotropy indicated slight neural damage in the association fibers of both hemispheres. The patient returned to work with mild attention deficit and aphasia. Initial diffusion-weighted imaging of a 75-year-old man with right upper extremity paresis showed high-intensity areas in the left corona radiata. Fractional anisotropy indicated bilateral neural damage to the corticospinal tract. The patient was discharged with severe right upper extremity impairment and a modified gait. Initial diffusionweighted imaging of a 60-year-old woman with moyamoya disease who experienced a sudden loss of consciousness showed high-intensity areas in the left anterior circulation territories. Fractional anisotropy indicated severe damage to the right hemisphere, the corticospinal tract, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus of the left hemisphere.

The ML-based analysis included developing models based on support vector machine (SVM) using histogram-based measures of dMRIbased tract profiles (e.g., mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness), following a recursive feature elimination (RFE) method based on SVM (SVM-RFE). Our model achieved high performance (74\% sensitivity, 75\% specificity, 74\% overall accuracy and 77\% AUC). Incorporating the patients’ demographics and clinical features such as age, tumor WHO grade, tumor location, gender and resting motor threshold (RMT) into our designed models demonstrated that these features were not as effective as microstructural measures.

	abstract = {Objective: Tractography has been used to define the presurgical location of white matter tracts, but this is subjective and time-intensive, making incorporation to imaging workflow at scale problematic. The objective is to validate a fully automated pipeline using the TractSeg algorithm (Wasserthal et al. NeuroImage 2018;183:239–253) to segment the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to the corticospinal tract.
	Methods: The process of importing a structural MPRAGE sequence and raw diffusion weighted images from PACS, executing the TractSeg algorithm, overlaying the resulting bilateral corticospinal tracts on the MPRAGE image, and exporting this composite image to PACS was automated. This procedure was used to segment the corticospinal tract in 28 patients with brain masses adjacent to or displacing the corticospinal tract. These segmentations were compared with both manual deterministic tractography performed with DSI Studio using seeds placed in the pons and an automated tractography method in DSI Studio.
	Results: The automated algorithm was able to segment the bilateral corticospinal tracts in all 28 patients whereas the manual reference method and DSI Studio based automated tractography were unsuccessful in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In all cases, the TractSeg segmentations very closely matched the manual segmentations. Also, TractSeg appeared to include larger portions of the lateral corticospinal tract fibers than the other 2 methods.
	Conclusion: The TractSeg algorithm demonstrated robust performance in segmenting the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to this tract. The algorithm is fast to perform and has great potential for optimizing and streamlining neurosurgical planning.},

	abstract = {Objective: To construct a clinical diagnostic biomarker using state-of-the-art microstructural MRI in the motor cortex of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
	Methods: Clinical and MRI data were obtained from 21 ALS patients (aged 54 ± 14 years, 33\% female) and 63 age- and gender-matched controls (aged 48 ± 18 years, 43\% female). MRI was acquired at 3T and included T1weighted scan (for volumetrics), arterial spin labelling (for cerebral blood ﬂow), susceptibility-weighted angiography (for iron deposition) and multiband diﬀusion kurtosis imaging (for tissue microstructure). Group diﬀerences in imaging measures in the motor cortex were tested by general linear model and relationships to clinical variables by linear regression.
	Results: The ALS group had mild-to-moderate impairment (disease duration: 1.8 ± 0.8 years; ALS functional rating scale 40.2 ± 6.0; forced vital capacity 83\% ± 22\%). No age or gender diﬀerences were present between groups. We found signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in diﬀusion kurtosis metrics (apparent, mean, radial and axial kurtosis: p {\textless} .01) and iron deposition in the motor cortex (p = .03). Within the ALS group, we found signiﬁcant relationships between motor cortex volume, apparent diﬀusion and disease duration (adjusted R2 = 0.27, p = .011); and between the apparent and radial kurtosis metrics and ALS functional rating scale (adjusted R2 = 0.25, p = .033). A composite imaging biomarker comprising kurtosis and iron deposition measures yielded a maximal diagnostic accuracy of 83\% (81\% sensitivity, 85\% speciﬁcity) and an area-under-the-curve of 0.86.
	Conclusion: Diﬀusion kurtosis is sensitive to early changes present in the motor region in ALS. We propose a composite imaging biomarker reﬂecting tissue microstructural changes in early ALS that may provide clinically valuable diagnostic information.},

It is based on a learned mapping from the original ﬁber orientation distribution function (FOD) peaks to tract speciﬁc peaks, called tract orientation maps. Each tract orientation map represents the voxel-wise principal orientation of one tract. Here, we present an extension of this approach that combines TOM with accurate segmentations of the tract outline and its start and end region. We also introduce a custom probabilistic tracking algorithm that samples from a Gaussian distribution with ﬁxed standard deviation centered on each peak thus enabling more complete trackings on the tract orientation maps than deterministic tracking. These extensions enable the automatic creation of bundle-speciﬁc tractograms with previously unseen accuracy.},

Twenty-four ALS patients and twenty-four demographically matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The Automated Fiber Quantiﬁcation (AFQ), a tool for the automatic reconstruction of white matter tract proﬁles, based on a deterministic tractography algorithm to automatically identify the CST and quantify its diffusion properties, was used. At a group level, the highest non-overlapping DTI-related differences were detected in the cerebral peduncle, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and primary motor cortex. Fractional anisotropy (FA) decrease and mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increases were detected when comparing ALS patients to controls. The machine learning approach used to assess the clinical utility of this DTI tool revealed that, by combining all DTI metrics measured along tract between the cerebral peduncle and the corona radiata, a mean 5-fold cross validation accuracy of 80\% was reached in discriminating ALS from controls. Our study provides a useful new neuroimaging tool to characterize ALS-related neurodegenerative processes by means of CST proﬁle. We demonstrated that speciﬁc microstructural changes in the upper part of the brainstem might be considered as a valid biomarker. With further validations this method has the potential to be considered a promising step toward the diagnostic utility of DTI measures in ALS. Hum Brain Mapp 38:727–739, 2017.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows direct visualization and volumetric analysis of the corticospinal tract (CST). The purpose of this study was to determine whether color maps and fiber tracking derived from DTI data are valuable in detecting and quantifying CST degeneration in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
	METHODS: Sixteen patients with ALS with clinical signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement and 17 healthy subjects were studied with the use of DTI. Disease severity was determined by means of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and an UMN involvement score. DTI was acquired with a 12-direction, single-shot, spin-echo echo-planar sequence. The CST from the lower pons to the corona radiata at the level of the corpus callosum on 4 contiguous coronal sections was manually segmented by using color maps generated from the DTI data. The left and right CST volumes were measured separately and normalized to the total intracranial volume. Normalized CST volumes were compared between patients with ALS and healthy subjects.
	RESULTS: The CST volumes of patients with ALS were significantly reduced (P .01, unpaired t test) compared with healthy subjects, in both affected and nonaffected hemispheres. No significant correlation was found between CST volumes and any of the clinical parameters, including disease duration, ALSFRS-R, or UMN involvement score.
	CONCLUSION: This study shows that volumetric analysis by using DTI-based color maps is valuable in detecting and monitoring structural degeneration of the CST. This will lead to objective and quantitative assessment of axonal degeneration in ALS.},

	abstract = {Investigative studies of white matter (WM) brain structures using diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography frequently require manual WM bundle segmentation, often called "virtual dissection." Human errors and personal decisions make these manual segmentations hard to reproduce, which have not yet been quantified by the dMRI community. It is our opinion that if the field of dMRI tractography wants to be taken seriously as a widespread clinical tool, it is imperative to harmonize WM bundle segmentations and develop protocols aimed to be used in clinical settings. The EADC-ADNI Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol achieved such standardization through a series of steps that must be reproduced for every WM bundle. This article is an observation of the problematic. A specific bundle segmentation protocol was used in order to provide a real-life example, but the contribution of this article is to discuss the need for reproducibility and standardized protocol, as for any measurement tool. This study required the participation of 11 experts and 13 nonexperts in neuroanatomy and "virtual dissection" across various laboratories and hospitals. Intra-rater agreement (Dice score) was approximately 0.77, while inter-rater was approximately 0.65. The protocol provided to participants was not necessarily optimal, but its design mimics, in essence, what will be required in future protocols. Reporting tractometry results such as average fractional anisotropy, volume or streamline count of a particular bundle without a sufficient reproducibility score could make the analysis and interpretations more difficult. Coordinated efforts by the diffusion MRI tractography community are needed to quantify and account for reproducibility of WM bundle extraction protocols in this era of open and collaborative science.},

Further, our method simplifies the quantification and statistical analysis of white matter tracts on large diffusion MRI databases. This work reflects the careful syntactical definition of major white matter fiber tracts in the human brain based on a neuroanatomist’s expert knowledge. The framework is based on a novel query language with a near-to-English textual syntax. This query language makes it possible to construct a dictionary of anatomical definitions that describe white matter tracts. The definitions include adjacent gray and white matter regions, and rules for spatial relations. This novel method makes it possible to automatically label white matter anatomy across subjects. After describing this method, we provide an example of its implementation where we encode anatomical knowledge in human white matter for ten association and 15 projection tracts per hemisphere, along with seven commissural tracts. Importantly, this novel method is comparable in accuracy to manual labeling. Finally, we present results applying this method to create a white matter atlas from 77 healthy subjects, and we use this atlas in a small proof-of-concept study to detect changes in association tracts that characterize schizophrenia.},

	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. However, no reliable biomarkers have been identified to represent the clinical status. This study aimed to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings are useful imaging biomarkers to indicate the clinical status of ALS patients. Ninety-six probable or definite ALS cases and 47 age- and sex-matched, normal controls were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected at the time of DTI. DTI data were acquired using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner and analysed by voxel-wise statistical analyses for fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and mode of anisotropy. Compared with the healthy control group, the ALS group had significant differences in DTI scalars in the diffuse tracts of the brain, which was predominant in the corticospinal tract at the brainstem and cerebellar peduncle area. Furthermore, the DTI values correlated with the ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) scores and the delta ALSFRS-R score representing the rate of disease progression. The subgroup analysis revealed a more severe and widespread brain degeneration was observed in rapidly progressive ALS. Therefore, our results suggest that DTI findings are useful as imaging biomarkers for evaluating the clinical severity and rate of disease progression in ALS.},
