# Troubleshooting

Symptom → fix for the failures users hit most often.

## Pipeline failures

### Extraction returns very few (or no) streamlines

**Symptom**: `csttool extract` completes but `cst_left.trk` / `cst_right.trk` contain a handful of streamlines or are empty.

**Likely causes and fixes**:

1. **Field-of-view does not cover both CST endpoints.** Run `csttool check-dataset --dwi <file>`. If brainstem coverage is missing, the acquisition cannot be salvaged. Otherwise see [Data formats](data-formats.md#fov-and-resolution).
2. **Whole-brain tractogram is too sparse.** Re-run `track` with `--seed-density 2` (or higher). With the default `--fa-thr 0.2` this typically yields a 2–4× denser whole-brain bundle.
3. **Registration failed.** Open `extract/visualizations/registration_qc.png` (requires `--save-visualizations`). Misaligned atlas → re-run with `--fast-registration` disabled, or check that the input FA map is not flipped (use `csttool check-dataset` to validate).

### Patch2Self denoising produces short streamlines

**Symptom**: After `--denoise-method patch2self`, tractography produces noticeably shorter streamlines and the FA map looks overly smooth.

**Fix**: Patch2Self assumes a sufficient number of diffusion volumes (~30+). For low-volume acquisitions, switch to NLMeans:

```bash
csttool preprocess --nifti raw.nii.gz --out ./preproc --denoise-method nlmeans
```

### `extract` fails with a coordinate-system error

**Symptom**: Error mentions affine, voxel-to-world, or coordinate validation.

**Fix**: This usually means the tractogram and FA map come from different processing runs with different reslicing. Re-run `track` and `extract` against the same `preprocess` output. As a last-resort debug, pass `--skip-coordinate-validation` — but treat any extraction it produces with suspicion.

## Installation

### WeasyPrint fails to install or render PDFs

**Symptom**: `--generate-pdf` raises `OSError: cannot load library 'libgobject-2.0-0'` or similar.

**Fix**: WeasyPrint needs system libraries that are not pulled in by `pip`.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 libharfbuzz0b libffi-dev

# macOS
brew install pango libffi
```

If you do not need PDF reports, omit `--generate-pdf`; HTML and JSON outputs are produced regardless.

### Missing FSL / MRtrix dependencies

**Symptom**: `csttool check` flags missing external binaries.

**Fix**: `csttool` itself does not require FSL or MRtrix, but the atlases shipped via `csttool fetch-data` are derived from FSL data. Install FSL only if you intend to compare against FSL-tractography pipelines or run advanced QC.

### `dcm2niix` not found

**Symptom**: `csttool import --dicom ...` fails with `dcm2niix: command not found`.

**Fix**:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install dcm2niix

# macOS
brew install dcm2niix
```

Or install via conda: `conda install -c conda-forge dcm2niix`.

## Reproducibility

### Same input, different `.trk` files across runs

By default tracking is seeded (`--rng-seed 42`) and is bitwise reproducible. If you see drift between runs:

1. Confirm you did **not** pass `--random`, which disables seeding.
2. Pin library versions — Dipy and Numpy minor-version bumps can change floating-point output.
3. See the design rationale in [Limitations](../explanation/limitations.md).
