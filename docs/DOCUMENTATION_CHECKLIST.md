## 🚀 Getting Started (Priority: HIGH)

These are the first pages new users encounter.

- [x] **installation.md** — Dependencies, pip install, system deps, development setup
- [x] **quickstart.md** — End-to-end example from data to PDF report
  - [x] Show `csttool run` command with all flags
  - [x] Explain expected outputs (tractograms, reports)
  - [x] Link to sample data (HCP or Brainlife) - This is done in recommended_datasets.md
- [x] **data-requirements.md** — Input format specifications
  - [x] NIfTI + bval/bvec requirements
  - [x] DICOM directory structure
  - [x] FOV and resolution requirements
  - [x] Gradient file naming conventions (.bval/.bvec vs .bvals/.bvecs)

## 📝 Writing Guidelines

When writing documentation:

1. **Keep it concise** — Users want answers, not essays
2. **Show, don't tell** — Use code examples liberally
3. **Test your examples** — Every command should work
4. **Link related pages** — Help users navigate
5. **Use admonitions** — `!!! note`, `!!! warning`, `!!! tip`

---

## 🎯 Recommended Order

1. ✅ `installation.md` (DONE)
2. `quickstart.md`
3. `data-requirements.md`
4. CLI Reference (all 7 pages)
5. `troubleshooting.md`
6. `first-analysis.md`
7. Everything else
