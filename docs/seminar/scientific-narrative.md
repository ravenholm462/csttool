# Scientific Narrative of ``csttool``

## Problem Statement

Diffusion-weighted MRI enables quantitative assessment of white matter microstructure and is widely used in the study of corticospinal tract degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, CST extraction and quantification typically rely on complex, multi-step pipelines involving multiple software environments, manual ROI handling, and non-standardized parameter settings. This introduces variability in tract definition, metric extraction, and reproducibility across studies.

There is currently no lightweight, end-to-end, command-line tool written entirely in Python that standardizes deterministic CST extraction and automated quantification of diffusion tensor metrics using minimal user interaction and exclusively open-source components.

`csttool` addresses this gap by providing a reproducible, modular CLI workflow that accepts diffusion-weighted MRI data and produces hemisphere-specific CST bundles along with quantitative tract-level metrics.

## Core Contribution

Given a diffusion-weighted MRI dataset, `csttool`:

- Extracts left and right corticospinal tract bundles using deterministic tractography and ROI-based inclusion criteria

- Computes tract-level diffusion tensor metrics including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity

- Derives a laterality index to quantify CST asymmetry

- Executes as a single CLI workflow with minimal manual intervention

The emphasis is on reproducibility, automation, and interpretability.

## Rationale For Deterministic Tractography

Deterministic tractography was selected to align with the objective of standardized and reproducible tract-level quantification.

Deterministic tracking produces explicit streamline trajectories derived from principal diffusion directions, allowing direct control over seeding, stopping criteria, and ROI-based filtering. This increases transparency of the extraction logic and reduces stochastic variability introduced by probabilistic sampling methods.

The goal of `csttool` is not to model tract uncertainty, but to provide stable and interpretable tract-level diffusion metrics suitable for automated comparison across subjects. Within this context, deterministic tractography provides a methodologically consistent and computationally efficient framework.

## Validation Philosophy

The validation of `csttool` evaluates technical correctness and methodological equivalence relative to established pipelines.

Validation includes:

- Spatial agreement between CST bundles generated by `csttool` and reference bundles extracted using established tools

- Quantitative overlap measures such as Dice similarity coefficient

- Assessment of the proportion of streamlines consistent with reference bundles

- Stability of derived diffusion tensor metrics and laterality indices

The objective is to demonstrate that `csttool` produces CST reconstructions and tract-level metrics consistent with established approaches while maintaining full automation and reproducibility.

## Definition of Success

Success is defined by the following criteria:

1. Consistent extraction of anatomically plausible left and right CST bundles using fixed processing logic.

2. Spatial agreement with established reference pipelines within predefined similarity thresholds.

3. Stable computation of tract-level diffusion metrics and laterality indices under fixed parameter settings.

4. Fully automated execution through a single command-line interface without manual ROI placement.

Under these conditions, `csttool` fulfills its role as a reproducible and standardized CST quantification tool.
